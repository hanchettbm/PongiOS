# Overview
My app is a game, it is a two player pong game that has 2 paddles, and one ball, 2 users can touch each paddle on either end of the screen, and move them around to bounce the ball off of it. If the ball gets past your paddle the other person gains a point. It is a simple fun game that focuses on user input.  

*Purpose*  
The purpose for creating this app was to learnswift and iPhone app design as well as to create something fun but useful that actually would be worth submitting to the app store. I am working to learn to create fun and useful apps that eventually could turn a prophet (through adds possibly).
